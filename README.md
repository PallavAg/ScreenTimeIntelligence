Block distracting apps on your iPhone. When you want them unblocked, explain why to Apple Intelligence and it chooses how long to let you unblock your apps for.

## ✨ How it works

🎯 **Select apps** → Choose which apps to block  
🔒 **Block Apps** → They're now blocked system-wide  
🤖 **Ask AI** → Explain why you need access  
⏰ **Get time** → AI decides how long to unblock
